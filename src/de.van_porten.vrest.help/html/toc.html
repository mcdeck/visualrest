<h1>Visual REST</h1>
<h2>A graphical editor environment for resource-oriented applications</h2>
<p>
Modeling applications using graphical or textual domain-specific languages is a constant
subject of research and development in modern software engineering.
</p>
<p>
However, model-driven  development  of  resource-oriented  applications is not
well  supported through specialized tools,  yet.   Using generic modeling languages like UML is
possible. Regrettably, this does not reflect the special needs of the
resource-oriented approach to application design. Dedicated support for the development
of such applications is desirable.
</p>
<p>
Especially the development of graphical languages suffers from a lack of focus on cognitive
effective syntax. Modeling semantics is regarded with far more importance than modeling
syntax.  In his work “The physics of notations”, Daniel Moody therefore proposes nine
principles that aid in the development of proper graphical syntax.  These nine principles
form a modular framework for the development of a cognitive effective visual language.
</p>
<p>
Visual REST offers a visual language for developing resource-oriented applications based on these nine
principles. The language is used to describe the server-side application only.
