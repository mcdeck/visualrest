## What is Visual REST

Visual REST is a graphical modeling language for the design of
resource-oriented applications. We implemented an
[Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org)-based editor based on
[Graphiti](http://www.eclipse.org/graphiti/) that enables creation of
application models. As of today, Code generation is not part of that
IDE, but we plan to add this in the future.

I developed Visual REST as part of my master’s thesis at the University of Hagen in 2012. 
It is implemented as an Eclipse-based editor using Graphiti and enables creation of application models. 
As of today, code generation is not part of the IDE, though.
